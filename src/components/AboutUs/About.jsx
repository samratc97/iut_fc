          In this work, a new algorithm is presented based on scale invariant
          feature transform adapted to the RGB color space. First, a top down
          search process is performed by comparing the ratio of matched
          keypoints extracted via SIFT for every R, G and B channels of two
          video frames separated by a temporal sampling period N. Then, an
          algorithm is used to detect the shot boundaries. Finally, the moving
          average of frames in the boundaries is calculated to determine the
          type of the transition by using a threshold. Our method is applied to
          different types of video and shows satisfactory performance in
          detecting abrupt changes and gradual transitions, but it can be
          improved by using weighting coefficients to calculate the ratioRGB
          from the three ratios(R,G and B), depending on the type of the video.
          In the future works,we aim to include performance improvements and
          minimizing the computational cost without decreasing the accuracy.

          The low recall rate in sports video is may be due to the short shots
          that are missed between the sampled frames. In contrast, the precision
          rates in this kind of videos are more than 90%. It shows that the
          method is effective in detecting abrupt and gradual transitions.On the
          other side, in general, recall rates are low. This reveals that some
          frames belonging to different shots were regarded as similar. As a
          result, several shot boundaries are missed.

          To ensure that the background image fits the entirety of the section,
          even if stretched, you can use the background-size: cover; property in
          your CSS. This property scales the background image so that it covers
          the entire area of the section.
